# Hues and Lows

WebApp to help you be more personally aware of your feelings. Focuses on clean and minimal UI and analytics.

## How to run

WebApp:
```
npm i && npm start
```

Server:
```
cd backend && mix run --no-halt
```

## Build Status
Doesn't build at all because it is in the middle of being ported to TypeScript so it is pretty much broken.

## Development Status
I am currently porting this codebase to TypeScript and moving from Class Components to Functional Components with Hooks in my free time. This was initially an entry for [VandyHacks VI](https://vandyhacks.org/) by the four of us (see Contributors). There are no set in stone deadlines regarding what I want to finish by when but there is somewhat of a [plan](./PLAN.md) regarding how I plan on going about the same.

## Contributing
The joy of open source! PRs are very much welcome. Feel free to create issues if you find a new bug.
